# 3bld-lettering-scheme-trainer

This mini page implements a tool to help a person practice the Speffz lettering scheme (white top, green front), a common way of labeling each non-center sticker on a Rubik's cube to help in blindfolded solving. 
A user can choose to practice either corners, edges, or both. 
A random piece gets drawn on the canvas, after which the user inputs what they think the letter is (the topmost square in the picture being the sticker of interest). 
If they get it right, the canvas flashes green, the streak counter increases by 1, and a new piece is drawn.
If they get it wrong, the canvas flashes red and, the streak counter resets to 0, and they get another chance at guessing the letter. 
All the pieces in the set will be gone through before starting it over. Note that switching sets will reset the streak counter and the set "history".
